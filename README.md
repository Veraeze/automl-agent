# AutoML Data & Training Agent

This project is an end-to-end AutoML Data & Training Agent built with Python. The agent independently finds datasets on the internet, downloads and preprocesses them, trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and automatically selects and saves the best-performing model. It is designed to remove manual data handling and demonstrate a fully autonomous machine learning pipeline using industry-standard tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Joblib.


This AI agent automatically:
- Finds datasets online
- Downloads the dataset
- Cleans the data
- Trains multiple machine learning models
- Evaluates performance
- Selects and saves the best model

Tools used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Requests
